<h4>A. e-invoice - Background:</h4>
<p>The GST Council, in its 37th meeting held on 20th September, 2019, approved introduction of electronic invoice ('e-invoice') in GST in a phased manner. </p>
<p>Accordingly, steps have been initiated to introduce 'e-invoicing' for reporting of Business to Business (B2B) and export invoices. </p>
<p>From October 1st, 2020, e-invoicing was made mandatory for taxpayers with aggregate turnover of more than Rs. 500 Cr. in any preceding financial year since 2017-18 (Vide Notification 13 of 2020 – Central Tax Dt. 21-3-2020 read with 61/2020 – Central Tax Dt. 30-7-2020). From 1st January, 2021 the turnover threshold was brought down to Rs. 100 Cr. (Vide Notification No. 88/2020 – Central Tax Dt. 10-11-2020) From 1st April, 2021, the threshold is going to be further brought down to Rs. 50 Cr. (Vide Notification No. 05/2021 – Central Tax Dt. 8-3-2021) </p>
<h4>B. e-invoice - Concept:</h4>
<p>As per Rule 48(4) of CGST Rules, notified class of registered persons (whose aggregate turnover in any preceding financial year from 2017-18 onwards, is more than prescribed limit) have to prepare invoice by uploading specified particulars of invoice (in FORM GST INV-01) on Invoice Registration Portal (IRP) and obtain an Invoice Reference Number (IRN). </p>
<p>After following above <i>'e-invoicing'</i> process, the invoice copy containing inter alia, the IRN (with QR Code) issued by the notified supplier to buyer is commonly referred to as <strong>'e-invoice'</strong>. </p>
<p>As per Rule 48(5), any invoice issued by a notified person in any manner <i>other than the manner specified in Rule 48(4),</i> the same shall not be treated as an invoice.</p>
<p>It is important to mention that 'e-invoicing' is not generation of invoice by a Government portal. Taxpayers will continue to create their GST invoices on their own Accounting/Billing/ERP Systems. <u>These invoices will now be reported to 'Invoice Registration Portal (IRP)'. On reporting, IRP will generate a unique 'Invoice Reference Number (IRN)', digitally sign it and return the e-invoice. A GST invoice will be valid only with a valid IRN.</u> </p>
<p>IRP will also generate a QR code containing the unique IRN along with certain other key particulars. The QR code (which can be printed on invoice) enables offline verification of the fact whether the e-invoice has been reported on the IRP or not <i>(using Mobile App etc.) </i> </p>
<p>The standard format for e-invoice was notified as 'INV-01'. This format (called ‘schema’) facilitates seamless exchange of invoices between accounting systems of suppliers and buyers in an integrated electronic format.</p>
<h4>C. e-invoice – Advantages:</h4>
<p>e-invoice has many advantages for businesses such as Auto-reporting of invoices into GST return, auto-generation of e-way bill (where required). </p>
<p>e-invoicing will also facilitate <i>standardisation and interoperability leading to reduction of disputes among transacting parties, improve payment cycles, reduction of processing costs and thereby greatly improving overall business efficiency.</i> </p>
<h4>D. e-invoice – Applicability:</h4>
<p>The documents presently covered by 'e-invoice' system are: Invoices, Credit Notes and Debit Notes, issued by notified class of taxpayers to registered persons (B2B) and for exports. Though different documents are covered, for ease of reference and understanding, the system is referred as 'e-invoicing'.</p>
<p>Certain classes of registered persons have been exempted from issuing e-invoices, viz. <i>Special Economic Zone Units, insurer or a banking company or a financial institution, including a non-banking financial company, goods transport agency supplying services in relation to transportation of goods by road in a goods carriage, Suppliers of passenger transportation service, Suppliers of services by way of admission to exhibition of cinematograph films in multiplex screens.</i></p>
<h4>E. e-invoice – Work flow:</h4>
<p>The overall work flow of 'e-invoice' system is as follows:</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="images/work_flow.jpg" alt="work_flow" /></p>
<br>
<h4>F. e-invoice – Salient Features:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Presently, e-invoicing is not voluntary, i.e. entities having prescribed aggregate turnover only can report invoices to IRP.</li>
<li>IRP is only a pass through validation portal. Certain key fields will be validated on IRP. So, IRN will be generated instantaneously, in sub-200 millisecond duration. The server capacity is robust enough to handle simultaneous uploads. Further, multiple IRPs will be made available to distribute the load of invoice registration.</li>
<li>Where e-invoicing is applicable, carrying e-invoice print during transportation of goods is not mandatory. As per Rule 138A(2) of CGST Rules, where e-invoicing is applicable, <i>"the Quick Reference (QR) code having an embedded Invoice Reference Number (IRN) in it, may be produced electronically, for verification by the proper officer, in lieu of the physical copy of such tax invoice."</i></li>
<li>There is no validation to the effect that the 'document date' (in the payload to IRP) has to be within a specified time window, for reporting to IRP/generation of IRN.</li>
<li>Penal provisions for not issuing invoice in accordance with GST Law/rules are provided in Section 122 of CGST/SGST Act, read with CGST/SGST Rules.</li>
<li>An invoice/IRN can't be cancelled partially. It has to be cancelled in toto. Cancellation of invoices is governed by Accounting Standards and other applicable rules/regulations.</li>
<li>An IRN/invoice reported to IRP can be cancelled within 24 hours. In case of cancellation of IRN, GSTR-1 also will be updated with such ‘cancelled’ status. However, if the connected e-way bill is active or verified by officer during transit, cancellation of IRN is <u><strong>not</strong></u> permitted.</li>
<li>Obtaining IRN by notified taxpayers is a legal requirement before issue of specified documents to recipients. Upon generation of IRN, amendments are not possible on IRP and cancellation of IRN only is permitted within a time window. So, the details of invoices actually issued during the tax period have to be reported in GSTR-1.<br>
  GSTR-1 is the final and self-assessed statutory statement of outward supplies by taxpayer, at the end of tax period. In the e-invoices auto-populated in GSTR-1 tables, taxpayers shall delete the details, wherever required, as per the documents actually cancelled during the tax period.</li>
<li>Once an IRN is cancelled, the concerned invoice number cannot be used again to generate another e-invoice/IRN.</li>
<li>On successful reporting of invoice details to IRP, the GST system will auto-populate them into GSTR-1 of the supplier and GSTR-2A of respective receivers. With source marked as 'e-invoice', IRN and IRN date will also be shown in GSTR-1 and GSTR-2A.</li>
<li>For items outside GST levy, separate invoice may be given by such businesses, e.g. <i>a hotel invoicing a B2B supply where the supply includes food and beverages (leviable to GST) and Alcoholic beverages (outside GST).</i></li>
<li>IRP doesn't store invoices and the facility to download e-invoice JSON is available only for limited number of days on the IRP. So, the taxpayers shall take care accordingly.</li>
<li>Even in the e-invoicing regime, while transporting goods, wherever the e-way bill is needed, the requirement continues to be mandatory.</li>
<li><strong>B2C Dynamic QR Code:</strong>  Notification No. 14/2020-Central Tax dated 21st March, 2020 (as amended)) mandated certain entities to include a dynamic Quick Response Code (QR Code) on their B2C invoices. This is a separate requirement and has no relevance or applicability to 'e-invoicing' under Rule 48(4).</li>
